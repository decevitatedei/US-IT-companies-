This project is a three-stage pipeline for collecting IT company data, finding their CEOs, and retrieving CEO contact details. In the first stage, `scrape_companies.py` uses Playwright to scrape the Clutch.co US IT services directory, extracting company name, location, and real website URL, saving results to `clutch_us_it_companies_playwright.csv` while avoiding duplicates. In the second stage, `find_ceo.py` loads the CSV, searches Bing for “CEO of {company\_name},” and applies a Stanza NLP pipeline to extract the CEO’s name, storing the data in `clutch_us_it_companies_with_ceo.csv`. In the third stage, `get_contacts.py` uses the RocketReach API to fetch email and phone information for each CEO based on their name and company, appending this data to the dataset. The result is a complete CSV containing company, location, website, CEO name, and contact details. This pipeline automates lead generation and enrichment for IT companies in the US market.
